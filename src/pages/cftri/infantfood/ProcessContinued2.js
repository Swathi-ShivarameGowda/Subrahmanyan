There was  degradation of thiamine of 15% at room temperature stored samples and 25% in that stored at 37{'\u00b0'}C.

                <div className="earlylifepara" >Daniel <font style={{fontStyle:'Italic'}}>et al</font> 1968(29) report that rats fed Amul baby food where the protein had been brought down to 10% and which had not been supplanted with methionine had poorer growth rate and had  fatty liver (low protein diets cause accumulation of fat in liver) . All the others were sufficient for good rat growth even though addition of methionine increased this in all cases. The results clearly indicate that methionine helps rat weight gain (since rats that grow more have more hair and sulphur amino acids) The authors conclude that bringing down the protein content and supplementation would help double the amount of milk used for infant food. However why just using less milk powder would not do the same thing is not clear. One interesting point that emerges from their data is the change in fat content in the Amul baby food obtained by these workers and that reported previously.(11)</div>

                <div className="earlylifepara" >Singh, 1982 (34)  formulated a spray dried infant based on milk whey (made by adding rennet). Whey and milk were mixed , warmed, electrodialysed and  homogenised. (This was carried out to increase the lactoglobulin component relative to casein and to decrease the calcium levels in buffalo milk). Similarly cream sperated from milk was homogenized and blended with coconut,. Groundnut and palm  oils. Whey was sterilised , inocluated with B.bifidus. Post homogenization, -lactose monohydrate was added (Addition of crystalline -lactose monohydrate to the infant food improved the flow propeties of the powder while reducing hygroscopicity of the product.    Spray drying was carrried out with inlet air at 210{'\u00b0'}C and outlet air at 90{'\u00b0'}C. The product called  “Maternalized Infant Formula” (MIF) contained about  12.0% proteins, 26% fat, 56 % carbohydrates, 2.43% minerals and 2.68% moisture.. </div>

These workers reported a biological value of about 91.8 for the infant food. . Rao, 1986 (36) and Rao and Mathur, 1987a,b (38,39) studied the effect of  preheating  milk to 95{'\u00b0'}C or 110{'\u00b0'}C on the physical properties of the infant food prepared from such milk. Chandrashekara <font style={{fontStyle:'Italic'}}>et al</font>, 1957 (10) had noted the effects of preheating milk on curd tension. Rao and Mathur, 1987c,d, (40) reported changes in solubility of protein on preheating the milk to 95{'\u00b0'}C or 110{'\u00b0'}C. They noted a decrease in content of non protein nitrogen and absence of albumin in the preheated samples as compared with that in raw milk.   Rao and Mathur, 1987d,e (41,42  (1987 )  reported changes in electrophoretic and ion exchnage chromatographic behaviour of proteins from preheated milk. kappa casein levels decreased and the amount of proteins eluting at higher strength of salt from proeins bound on to an ion exchange resin,.

                <div className="earlylifepara" >Invovlement of the Hannah Research Station Ayr, Scotland in the Indian buffalo  milk processing scenari,o began with the visit of Norman C. Wright Director of Hannah Dairy Research institute, Ayhrshire Scotland. In  1937  he submitted a reported  regarding  the development of cattle and dairy industries of India (1). L.C.Sikka, member of the Milk Industries report (2) had  submitted a thesis for award of Ph.D while  at The Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Kirkhill, Ayr and writes that “I wish to express my grateful appreciation of the facilities afforded to me by the Council of the Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Kirkhill, Ayr. I am deeply Indebted to Dr. N.C. Wright and Dr. A.B. Fowler for their constant interest and valuable advice, and to Dr. R.A. Robb and Dr. J. Wishart for advice on statistical problems”.</div>
                <br></br>
                <div className="earlylifepara" >The milk report (2) mentions that the Central Food Technological Research  Insitute at Mysore had began investigations into on  malted milk and infant foods. The government of India had requested the help of an expert on dried milk foods and the FAO deputed Dr.R. Waite of the Hannah Research Centre, Airshire, Scotland for six weeks in December 1955</div>
                <br></br>
                <div className="earlylifepara" >Dr Waite had become an established authority on dried milk and, in 1955, on the invitation of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, he spent two months in India advising on a programme of research on the manufacture of invalid and infant foods (<a href="https://www.hannahdairyresearch.org.uk/hannah-dairy-research-history/" target="_blank" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} ><font color="#3819e9">https://www.hannahdairyresearch.org.uk/hannah-dairy-research-history/</font></a>). He visited the C.F.T.R.I. as well as different parts of the country and  made  the following recommendations a) that a small experimental factory be set up in a part of the country where buffalo and cows milk would not be required for supply to towns. b) Work to be carried out by the C.F.T.R.I. Mysore, Ministry of Food or any other place to reduce bacterial load during milk collection. C) The Anand spray drying plant, if agreed to by the Owners (Kaira Milk Producers Cooperative Society) should produce some infant food in collaboration with the C.F.T.R.I  who would “plan the composition” and examine the storability of the product.        d) The C.F.T.R.I. should work with both imported skim milk powder and with both cow’s and buffalo milk to produce infant foods using both roller drying and spray drying. e) The C.F.T.R.I. should work on a) the bacteriological content of milk and milk powder prepared by spray drying, roller drying and vaccum drying  b) On the curd tension of the raw, processed and dried bufallo milk powder c) using containers other than tin cans for storage of the milk powder d) tableting of fruit flavoured powder e) preparation of lactic acid milk powders. Nurtitive studies on a large number of children should be carried out in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research or with those in the pratcise of medicine. These experiments should be be carried out when a bacteriologically safe powder has been manufactured at the Anand plant. The cocoa flavoured malted milk prepared at the C.F.T.R.I. should be devloped further. Lastly, the suggestion was made that a staff member associated with the project should be sent abroad  for some time after having worked on the problem of making infant food for a period of six months to a year. Chandrashekara visited NewZeland duirng that period and published a paper detailing his researches there in Richards and Chandrashekar (26).</div>
