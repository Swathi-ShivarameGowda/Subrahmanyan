                <div className="earlylifepara" >This is a short account of three processes developed under the guidance of V.Subrahmanyan. It is not clear whether the work on penicillin and hormones were used commercially. It would appear that there was some use in the medical institutions of Madras (Chennai). Again, whether the gluconate, protein and the soluble casein product was commercialized is not clear. However, Calcium caseinate is still in vogue. It is not clear how it is made. The drugs and pharmaceutical committee constituted by the C.S.I.R. in 1940 with Dr.Jivraj N.Mehta as chairman reviewed a project funded by the C.S.I.R. to Prof.V.Subrahmanyan (initiated 1944) on making penicillin more efficient and on the chemistry of penicillin. The project also involved production of extracts hormones from adrenals, pituitary and islets of Langerhans. A sum of Rs.55,831 had been sanctioned for the purpose (1).</div>

                    <div className="earlylifepara">One part of casein by weight was added to 3 parts volume of water (70{'\u00b0'}C) in a stainless-steel and washed repeatedly.  A Warring blender was used to blend the casein now suspended in 6N ammonia (80ml per 500g of casein). A thick solution at pH 10 was obtained. Calcium hydroxide solution equivalent to 1% of casein was added and kept aside for 2hr at room temperature prior to being rum dried at 50lb steam pressure. The flaky material (87 percent protein and about 6% sucrose) was powdered by passing through a 30-mesh sieve and was comparable with pharmaceutical calcium caseinate. It was highly acceptable organoleptically with good water dispersibility and attained pH of 5.8 when in water solution.  Addition of sucrose to calcium hydroxide increased the amount of calcium that could be incorporated. It was noted that the addition of calcium to fish protein extracts helped eliminate odor. In this product (drum- dried preparation of calcium caseinate)  the calcium protein bond, could withstand drumdrying at 50lb/in2 while preserving  easy water dispersiblity and lack of odour (4,6). This process was the subject of an Indian patent (7).  A nutrtional study, with nine  children who appeared to have symptoms of gross malnutrition using the cacium casienate as protein source, showed marked improvement (5). </div>
